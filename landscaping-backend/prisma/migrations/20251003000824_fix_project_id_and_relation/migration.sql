/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `createdAt` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `passwordHash` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Project` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Added the required column `password_hash` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `updated_at` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
